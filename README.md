<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Using a virtual environment, use pip to download the following libraries.
* pip
  ```sh
  pip install replicate opencv-python
  pip install --upgrade openai
  ```

### Installation
(*Note: We have already provided API keys within the config file for you to use, but we still need you to manually authenticate the replicate token*)
1. Get a free Replicate API Key at [https://replicate.com/account](https://replicate.com/account), or use the one in our config file.
2. In shell, set the token as an environment variable.
   ```sh
   export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=[token]
   ```
4. Clone the repo
